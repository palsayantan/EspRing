# EspRing

*ESP8266 and WS2812b Individually Addressable RGB LEDs [12 bit]*

**EspRing** is a 12 bit neopixel ring using **ws2812b** RGB LEDs and to control the LEDs there is an **ESP 12E** module builtin. So basically you'll get a *neopixel ring which has a onboard microcontroller*. Since WS2812B leds are individually addressable so we just need only one data pin from the microcontroller along with VCC and GND to run tons of such LEDs. As the name implies we can even control the colour and the brightness of each pixels. You can **assign different colors to each pixels and create mesmerizing animations and effects with it**. Since the module has wifi accessibility on it, so you can **change the effects or reprogram it over the air**, without touching the module. It has voltage regulator to step down 5v to 3.3v for esp8266.
